# Google Sheets Setup Guide

This guide explains exactly how to structure your Google Sheets to work with your Credit Card Tracker dashboard.

## üìã Required Sheet Structure

Your Google Sheet must have exactly **5 tabs** with specific column headers:

### Tab 1: "Cards" (Master Card List)
This contains all possible credit cards and their basic information.

**Columns:**
- **Column A**: `Issuer` (e.g., "Chase", "American Express", "Capital One")
- **Column B**: `Card Name` (e.g., "Sapphire Reserve", "Gold Card", "VentureX")
- **Column C**: `Brand Class` (e.g., "Premium", "Gold", "Travel", "Cash Back")

**Example:**
```
A1: Issuer          B1: Card Name           C1: Brand Class
A2: Chase           B2: Sapphire Reserve    C2: Premium
A3: American Express B3: Gold Card          C3: Gold
A4: Capital One     B4: VentureX           C4: Premium
```

**How card names are formed:** The app combines Issuer + Card Name = "Chase Sapphire Reserve"
